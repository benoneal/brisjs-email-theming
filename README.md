# BrisJS - Theming Email with MJML 

This repo contains the example code snippets from my talk at this BrisJS October 2017. The slides [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xhOtwdpnfTfTl4pbW14UTISsS1vlJS15wwPm4NL-JOc).

The code examples were pulled from a live production application (and cleaned up for presentation clarity).

### MJML template and partial code examples

These examples illustrate my implementation of a templates and partials. They were developed by shamelessly stealing portions from MJML's template offerings and modifying values and content to suit my needs.

### Color management for themes

These examples illustrate my implementation of color management for whitelabel theming. The theme generator exposes helper methods to choose the best color from a prioritised list, according to a minimum contrast threshold determined against WCAG standards.
